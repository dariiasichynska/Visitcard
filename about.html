        O lovely maidens, fall in love, <br />
        But not with Muscovites, <br />For Muscovites are foreign folk,
        <br />They do not treat you right. <br />A Muscovite will love for
        sport, <br />And laughing go away; <br />He’ll go back to his Moscow
        land <br />And leave the maid a prey <br />To grief and shame...
        <br />It could be borne <br />If she were all alone, <br />But scorn is
        also heaped upon <br />Her mother frail and old. <br />The heart e’en
        languishing can sing – <br />For it knows how to wait; <br />But this
        the people do not see: <br />“A strumpet!“ they will say. <br />O lovely
        maidens, fall in love, <br />But not with Muscovites, <br />For
        Muscovites are foreign folk, <br />They leave you in a plight.

        We will never be brothers <br />not by motherland, nor by mother.
        <br />You don't have a spirit to be free- <br />even as stepbrothers we
        cannot be. <br />You are dubbed yourself as "older" brothers- <br />we
        could be younger, but not like the others. <br />There're so many of
        you, but, <br />what a pity you've no face. <br />You're huge, but we
        are great. <br />And you're squeezing... <br />you keep on toil, you
        will choke on your envy and oil. <br />The word freedom, to you is
        unknown, <br />you are in chains since the day you were born. <br />In
        your houses" silence is gold" will prevail, <br />and we're burning
        Molotov cocktails, <br />yes, we're hot blooded in our hearts, so,
        <br />what kind of blind kin you are to us? <br />And we all have
        fearless eyes, <br />without a weapon we are still dangerous guys.
        <br />We are grown up and became brave like the knights <br />we are all
        in the sniper’s sights. <br />The executioners brought us to our knees-
        <br />we have rebelled and fixed everything. <br />And in vain, the rats
        are hiding and preying- <br />they will bath in their blood just the
        same. <br />You are getting the new directions- <br />and we are here,
        burning fires of insurrection. <br />We have democracy and you have the
        Czar, <br />We will never be brothers, we are.
